Basic inputs to consider:
- Consider n asteroids:
  - collision time (how long it takes for an asteroid to hit ship) - CZ
  - angle to evade the nearest asteroid (no asteroid in that trajectory) -JP
  - theta (angle for bullet to hit smallest asteroid) -YL
  - size of the asteroid -YL
      - Rules: hit biggest one last, shoot smallest ones first
