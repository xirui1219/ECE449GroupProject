Basic inputs to consider:
- Consider n asteroids:
  - collision time (how long it takes for an asteroid to hit ship) - CZ (3 mf)
  - angle to evade the nearest asteroid (no asteroid in that trajectory) -JP (5 mf)
  - theta (angle for bullet to hit smallest asteroid) -YL (5 mf)
    - size of the asteroid -YL
      - Rules: hit biggest one last, shoot smallest ones first

['l', 'h'] (2mf)
['l', 'm', 'h'] (3mf)
['l', 'ml', 'm', 'mh', 'h'] (5mf)
